# react-project

In this project I learned how to build a very simple React application. I worked in a real-world project for a fictional company that requires my help. The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that I will need to implement. React hooks will not be used here.

- Milestone 1: Basic project structure (see the following steps for details)
- Milestone 2: Components (see the following steps for details)
- Milestone 3: Styling (will be omitted in the initial implementation)
- Milestone 4: Calculations (see the following steps for details)
- Milestone 5: Event handlers (see the following steps for details)

# Tools Used

- React
- React-DOM
